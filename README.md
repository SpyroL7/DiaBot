Submission for discord hackweek 
Category: Bot - productivity

This bot was made for diabetes managment and insulin administration advice , but please don’t sue us for taking our unregistered medical advice, however excellent it may be.
I have been testing the bot here: https://discord.gg/hVpNR5u
Here is the add link: https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=593844320751058984&permissions=0&scope=bot
Use ‘$setup’ to give a list of commands and how to calculate your dose.
Bascially if you don't already know, people with diabetes need to administer insulin, and the amount of which depends on their blood sugar and what they're eating. This bot records your carbohydrates to insulin ratio (which is unique to every person), the amount of insulin required to bring your bloodsugar down if its too high (which is bad), what granularity your insulin doser can administer (some can do to the nearest 0.1 units, some can do to the nearest 0.5 units and some can do to the nearest 1) and how mnay carbs you're going to eat. It then works out how much insulin you should take, and if you're blood sugar is low, it warns you shouldn't. Complete with error catching and coloured embeds, I think this is a marvellous piece of code.
